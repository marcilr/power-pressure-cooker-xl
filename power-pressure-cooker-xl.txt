Quick Start Cooking Guide
=========================

3. Place lid on cooker with hangle and recessed valve
   pointed in the 10:00 o'clock position.
   Rotate lid counter-clockwise until you feel a click.
4. Rotate pressure valve to the lock position.
5. Follow your recipe for correct cook time.
6. For easiest cleanup wash power pressure cooker parts

The Secret of Power Cooking
===========================
Thanks to its incredible flavor infusion technology, the
Power Pressure Cooker XL traps super-heated steam inside the pot.
This high-pressure environment forces liquid and moisture into
your food, locking in intense flavor and nutrients.  The best
part is the intelligent one-touch settings for meat, fish,
vegetables, beans, rice, soup or stews.  Making your special beef
stew pressure cooker recipes? Just push the Stew button, and
the pressure cooker does the rest!
